# 🧠 Medical System (Cranius AI) - AI-Assisted Segmentation and Diagnosis Platform

## 📌 Description

This system allows doctors and healthcare professionals to upload medical images (T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR modalities), perform automatic segmentations with artificial intelligence models (such as `nnU-Net`), visualize comparisons with manual segmentations, generate visual explanations (Grad-CAM), and produce clinical reports in PDF format.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Angular + TailwindCSS
- **Deep Learning**: nnU-Net (v1), PyTorch
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Image Storage**: NIfTI (.nii.gz)
- **Reports**: Embedded HTML + `pdfkit` + `wkhtmltopdf`
- **Additional scraping (optional)**: Selenium, BeautifulSoup

## 🧪 Model Training

The model was trained on the **BraTS 2023 (ASNR-MICCAI)** dataset using `nnU-Net v1`.

To train with two modalities (for example, T1 and T1c), the following configuration was used:

```bash
nnUNet_plan_and_preprocess -t 501 --verify_dataset_integrity
nnUNet_train 2d nnUNetTrainerV2 501 0 --npz
```

> The data is organized in `nnUNet_raw/Task501_BrainTumour/` following the official format.

---

## 📄 Report Generation

Each patient has a unique folder (`YYYY-MM-DD_patient_id`) where the following files are stored:

- `segmentation_summary.png`
- `class_distribution.png`
- `report.html`
- `report.pdf`

---

## 🩺 Clinical Applications

- Support for brain tumor diagnosis
- Automatic vs. manual visual evaluation
- Full traceability per patient
- Statistical record of usage and medical feedback

---

## 🔒 Authentication and Permissions

The system allows authenticated user roles (doctor) for full access to patient modules, reports, image uploads, and AI evaluation.
